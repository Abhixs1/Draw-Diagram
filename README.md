# Interactive Diagram Studio with Secure Authentication and Version Control

An enterprise-grade diagramming and workflow modeling platform built with Angular (frontend) and .NET Core Web API (backend). The platform enables users to create, style, and manage interactive diagrams with a drag-and-drop interface, robust version control, and secure authentication via Azure Active Directory (MSAL).

Designed with a scalable architecture and intuitive UI, this project demonstrates expertise in full-stack development, frontend engineering, backend API design, and cloud-based authentication systems.
